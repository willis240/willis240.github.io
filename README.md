### About Me

I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since then I have been running the airplane parts store at Northland Aviation Services
while working on a text-based adventure game in my spare time. Also I really enjoy making jokes, but you'd probably realize that pretty quick
once you get to know me. Don't worry, I'm funny. I promise.

### Skills

* Proficient in C++
* Some experience with Python
* Some experience with HTML/CSS

### Github Projects

* The aforementioned text-based adventure game (which I am still working on): https://github.com/willis240/Dungeon_Crawler
* My group's senior capstone project where we created a dashboard which displayed energy data it received from ACEP live (I worked primarily on the display, making my contributions
  primarily HTML and CSS code): https://github.com/willis240/Community_Energy_Awareness
* A 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe program I wrote for my AI class where I wrote a CPU that can either employ the Minimax algorithm for decision-making or the Monte Carlo Tree Search:
