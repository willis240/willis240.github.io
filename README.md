## About Me

Currently, I am a college student working toward a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. Though I do not have specific plans for what I intend to do after obtaining my degree, I intend to pursue a job in the Computer Science career field to further my skills following graduation.


### Off-Topic
All things considered, writing what needs to be added to the website on the website is very meta
