## About Me

Currently, I am a college student working toward a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. Though I do not have specific plans for what I intend to do after obtaining my degree, I intend to pursue a job in the Computer Science career field to further my skills following graduation.

My favorite site for watching a good video is [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/).
