### About Me

I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since then I have been running the airplane parts store at Northland Aviation Services
while working on a text-based adventure game in my spare time. Also I really enjoy making jokes, but you'd probably realize that pretty quick once you get to know me. Don't worry, I'm funny.
I promise.

### Skills

* Proficient in C++
* Some experience with Python
* Some experience with HTML/CSS

### Github Projects

* The aforementioned [text-based adventure game](https://github.com/willis240/Dungeon_Crawler) (which I am still working on)
* My group's [senior capstone project](https://github.com/willis240/Community_Energy_Awareness) where we created a dashboard which displayed energy data it received from ACEP live (I worked primarily on the display, making my contributions primarily HTML and CSS code)
* A [5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe program](https://github.com/willis240/Tic_Tac_Toe) I wrote for my AI class where I wrote a CPU that can either employ the Minimax algorithm for decision-making or the Monte Carlo Tree Search

### Dungeon Crawler

* For the last year and a half I have been working in my spare time on a text-based adventure game simply titled Dungeon Crawler (for now)
* It features several rooms for the player to explore by checking objects for hints, items, keys, etc.
* There are several decisions for the player to make throughout the game, including one right at the start where you have the option of stealing a rat's cheese
* There is also turn-based combat which currently is fairly standard, but I will be reworking it for sake of more interesting strategy
* All in all, this is a passion project which I foresee myself working on for quite some time still, and I hope to release it in an official capacity once it is finished
