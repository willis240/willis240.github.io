## About Me

I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since then I have been running the airplane parts store at Northland Aviation Services
while working on a text-based adventure game in my spare time: https://github.com/willis240/Dungeon_Crawler. Also I really enjoy making jokes, but you'd probably realize that pretty quick
once you get to know me. Don't worry, I'm funny. I promise.
